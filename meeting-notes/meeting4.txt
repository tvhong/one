4th meeting
so sleepy :(
*****
mostly talked about low-level things

rotation pattern representation:
    hardcoding patterns:
        easy
        more control
        less code
        a bit of work when introduce new Pieces (unlikely..)
    auto rotating (using a general algorithm):
        more code to write
        sound cool (lol)
        in the end will have to deal with special cases anyway

note: try to work on different files to avoid conflicts
